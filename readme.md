# ðŸŒš snoosings

the biggest singing-player game ever.

snoosings is essentially a networked drum machine with a twist: if your internet fails, it will loop, but otherwise you have to keep pressing the tones you want. each loop is limited to eight tones. there's a distance element too where the farther away you are from someone, the quieter they are.
